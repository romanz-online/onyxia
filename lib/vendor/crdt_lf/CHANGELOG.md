## [2.5.0](https://github.com/MattiaPispisa/crdt/tree/crdt_lf-v2.5.0/packages/crdt_lf)
**Date:** 2026-01-03

[compare to previous release](https://github.com/MattiaPispisa/crdt/compare/crdt_lf-v2.4.0...crdt_lf-v2.5.0)

### Added
- Added `garbageCollect` to `CRDTDocument` to prune the document history. It prunes the document history up to the given version vector. `VersionVector.intersection` can be used to compute the minimum common version vector that contains the minimum clock for each peer. [61](https://github.com/MattiaPispisa/crdt/issues/61)
- Added `fromVersionVector` to `CRDTDocument.exportChanges` to export changes that are newer than a given version vector.

### Changed
- Implemented hashCode memoization for `PeerId`, `FugueElementId`, `Change`, `ORHandlerTag`, `ORMapEntry`, `OperationId`, `OperationType`. Constructors are no longer const, resulting in faster equality checks and reduced CPU usage during heavy parsing or collection lookups.
- chore: improved example. Can now time travel and garbage collect the document history.

## [2.4.0](https://github.com/MattiaPispisa/crdt/tree/crdt_lf-v2.4.0/packages/crdt_lf)
**Date:** 2025-12-29

[compare to previous release](https://github.com/MattiaPispisa/crdt/compare/crdt_lf-v2.3.0...crdt_lf-v2.4.0)

### Added

- Added `HistorySession` to `CRDTDocument` to navigate the history of the document. It allows "Time travel" functionality by moving a temporal cursor back and forth through the changes. Can be called using `document.toTimeTravel()` [55](https://github.com/MattiaPispisa/crdt/issues/55)

### Changed
- CRDTDocument now extends `BaseCRDTDocument` instead of implementing it directly. `Handler`s now use `BaseCRDTDocument` instead of `CRDTDocument`.
- Improved `CRDTDocument` disposal management. After disposal, all operations on the document will throw `DocumentDisposedException` [57](https://github.com/MattiaPispisa/crdt/issues/57)
- Reuse tag creation logic in `CRDTORMapHandler` and `CRDTORSetHandler` to avoid code duplication [54](https://github.com/MattiaPispisa/crdt/issues/54)
- chore: improved documentation

## [2.3.0](https://github.com/MattiaPispisa/crdt/tree/crdt_lf-v2.3.0/packages/crdt_lf)
**Date:** 2025-12-24

[compare to previous release](https://github.com/MattiaPispisa/crdt/compare/crdt_lf-v2.2.0...crdt_lf-v2.3.0)

### Added

- Added `initialClock` to `CRDTDocument` constructor
- Added `prepareMutation` to `CRDTDocument` to prepare the system to perform a mutation

### Fixed

- `CRDTORMapHandler` and `CRDTORSetHandler` now refresh clock ("prepareMutation") before creating a tag [52](https://github.com/MattiaPispisa/crdt/issues/52) (thx to @gborges9)

## [2.2.0](https://github.com/MattiaPispisa/crdt/tree/crdt_lf-v2.2.0/packages/crdt_lf)
**Date:** 2025-11-22

[compare to previous release](https://github.com/MattiaPispisa/crdt/compare/crdt_lf-v2.1.0...crdt_lf-v2.2.0)

### Changed
- chore: improved documentation about version vector
- Can import snapshot even if there are newer changes in the document

### Fixed
- chore: fixed references links
- Fix `CRDTDocument.applyChange` to correctly handle dependencies that were pruned from the DAG [50](https://github.com/MattiaPispisa/crdt/issues/50)

## [2.1.0](https://github.com/MattiaPispisa/crdt/tree/crdt_lf-v2.1.0/packages/crdt_lf)
**Date:** 2025-10-31

[compare to previous release](https://github.com/MattiaPispisa/crdt/compare/crdt_lf-v2.0.0...crdt_lf-v2.1.0)

### Added
- Added `change` operation to `CRDTFugueTextHandler` and `CRDTTextHandler` [12](https://github.com/MattiaPispisa/crdt/issues/12)
- Added `CRDTORMapHandler` [41](https://github.com/MattiaPispisa/crdt/issues/41)

### Changed

- chore: improved Fugue text handler change implementation

### Fixed

- Fixed deserialization of Map values in `CRDTFugueTextHandler` operations

## [2.0.0](https://github.com/MattiaPispisa/crdt/tree/crdt_lf-v2.0.0/packages/crdt_lf)
**Date:** 2025-09-16

[compare to previous release](https://github.com/MattiaPispisa/crdt/compare/crdt_lf-v1.0.0...crdt_lf-v2.0.0)

**Breaking changes**
- Changed `CRDTFugueTextHandler` operations payload

### Added

- Created a set of mixins to be used by handlers to optimize performance during operation insertions.
- Thrown `HandlerAlreadyRegisteredException` when a handler is registered twice
- Added `TransactionManager` to manage transactional batching of notifications and local changes emission [43](https://github.com/MattiaPispisa/crdt/issues/43)
- Added `compound` "system" to compact consecutive operations during transaction [45](https://github.com/MattiaPispisa/crdt/issues/45)
- Added `CRDTORSetHandler` [42](https://github.com/MattiaPispisa/crdt/issues/42)

### Changed

- On `importChanges` listeners of `updates` are notified only one times at import end
- `Handlers` now not invalidate cache when an operation is applied due to the new mixins system. This greatly improves the computation of the handler value as it is persisted much more often.
- chore: improved handlers benchmark system

### Fixed
- `CRDTMapHandler` updating an absent key is ignored

## [1.0.0](https://github.com/MattiaPispisa/crdt/tree/crdt_lf-v1.0.0/packages/crdt_lf)
**Date:** 2025-08-18

[compare to previous release](https://github.com/MattiaPispisa/crdt/compare/crdt_lf-v0.8.0...crdt_lf-v1.0.0)

**Breaking changes**
Create a set of exception classes to be used across the library. Replace `StateError` with `CrdtException` and its subclasses.

- `applyChange`: throws `CausallyNotReadyException` instead of `StateError` when a change's dependencies are not met;
- On import when a cycle is detected among changes throws `ChangesCycleException` instead of `StateError`;
- On add node when a node already exists throws `DuplicateNodeException` instead of `StateError`;
- On add node when a dependency is missing throws `MissingDependencyException` instead of `StateError`;
- On Fugue tree insertion when a node already exists throws `DuplicateNodeException` instead of `Exception`.

Removed redundant `hlc` from `Change`. `change.hlc` is also available as getter [37](https://github.com/MattiaPispisa/crdt/issues/37)

Hlc in version vector is now serialized as string instead of int64. This avoids precision loss when serialized as JSON for web interoperability.

### Added
- `documentId` to `CRDTDocument`, specified document identity to remove ambiguity between peer and document [38](https://github.com/MattiaPispisa/crdt/issues/38) (thx to @Jei-sKappa)
- `toString` to `Snapshot` and `VersionVector`
- added a stream to `CRDTDocument` to be notified of every change (changes, snapshots, merges, ...)
- added `mutable` and method to `VersionVector` to create mutable copies
- added a export changes method to `CRDTDocument` to export changes that are newer than a given version vector

### Changed
- chore: setup .github/workflows and update coverage links [33](https://github.com/MattiaPispisa/crdt/issues/33)
- chore: update readme with recommended approach for complex handler types
- chore: update topological sort implementation [3](https://github.com/MattiaPispisa/crdt/issues/3)
- chore: added benchmarks

### Fixed
- Fix `CRDTFugueTextHandler` to ensure state is synchronized before performing operations [39](https://github.com/MattiaPispisa/crdt/issues/39)
- Fix readme reference links
- Fix double hlc increment on `CRDTDocument.createChange`
- Fix snapshot initialization for handlers that return a non primitive value
